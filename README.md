# Quantum-Neural-Network
An implementation of the NISQ neural network described in Farhi and Neven (1802.06002). 
Currently, our neural network is able to replicate the subset parity function on bitstrings (the first application analyzed in the paper). We are working to make it classify MNIST digits.
